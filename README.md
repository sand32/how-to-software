# How To Software
- Code is a tool
- Know your tools inside and out
- Don't let the tools prevent you from understanding the problem
- The problem is **always** that you have some data and you need it to be other data
- Do as little as possible while still solving the problem
- Making the problem look like a different problem does not solve the problem
